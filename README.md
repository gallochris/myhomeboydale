Dale Carnegie is My Homeboy 
====

If I could recommend one book to you, it would be [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie. Ignore the chessy title. Embrace the principles and learn to be considerate.

The site was inspired by [tomhaverfoods.com](http://tomhaverfoods.com). Reload the page to see all 30 principles from the book one at a time. And be a better human.
